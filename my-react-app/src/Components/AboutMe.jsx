            <p> I am a current student of the NothCoders intensive 3 month software development bootcamp. I am enjoying building up my portfolio of development projects and excited to share them with you here. I am looking to secure my first job in software development and open to both Front-End, Backend and full-stack development roles. Many thanks for looking!</p>
