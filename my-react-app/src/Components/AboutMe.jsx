            Hi, I'm Catherine, a junior software developer and graduate of the
            Northcoders intensive 3-month JavaScript software development
            course. I started dabbling with coding through learning Arduino
            programming for an animatronics project, and immediately caught the
            bug. This, combined with being drawn to the more technical aspects
            of a previous job in education technology, led me to take the plunge
            and sign up for the JavaScript course with Northcoders in 2024.
            <br></br> <br></br>After graduating, I initially volunteered as a
            front-end developer for a local social enterprise, and then secured
            a junior developer position working on a new knowledge management
            platform for the Ministry of Defence. In this role, I gained
            valuable experience across the full stack, from user-experience
            design and front-end feature development to API maintenance,
            end-to-end testing, adherence to accessibility standards, and client
            communication.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            Now the project has launched, I'm looking for new opportunities,
            with a particular interest in front-end development and user
            experience design. If you are looking for a new website for your
            business, or a website refresh, please get in touch.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            In the meantime, please take a look at the projects I have been
            working on below and feel free to send any questions or suggestions
            for improvements my way. Many thanks for looking!
